**DO T9 BEFORE EE50k**

### Graduation routing

Routing is based on your current Tau (\\(\tau\\)) and Phi (\\(\varphi\\)) numbers.

Make sure to use the [calculators and simulators](/#other-resources) for optimal graduation, student, star, and theory options.

### Push f(t) with 3R9 seapping

###### Memorize your student distributions with and without 30 R9 students. Use the [student calculator](https://conicgames.github.io/exponentialidle/students.html) if needed.
1. Wait till \\(f(t)\\) stops growing with students in R9 pushing \\(\tau\\).
2. Start accel (preferably keep it between prestiges).
3. Potentially sit here to stack t for bigger \\(\phi_2\\) when you have students in \\(\phi_2\\). Only
   do this when you are near a graduation mark. This is not useful if you will not swap into \\(\phi_2\\).
4. Respec all 30 students from R9.
5. Wait for the autoprestige to prestige and swap back students to R9.
6. Repeat.

#### R9 autoprestige expression

You can find the autoprestige used for R9 Seaping here: [Equation](https://exponential-idle-guides.netlify.app/guides/intro-to-grad/#new-autoprestige-expression). If you don't have this expression, then you will have to manually prestige each time (turn it off before seaping).

### Idle and Active buy strats
For best results use the <a href="https://replit.com/@xelaroc/AnthSim">Theory Sim</a> and <a href="https://exponential-idle-guides.netlify.app/guides/theory-sim/">Sim Guide</a> to give the best strategy and multiplier for the next publications.


### How to respec

See the [introduction guide](https://exponential-idle-guides.netlify.app/guides/intro-to-grad/#respecing-students) for respecing students and
milestones.

#### Lemma

All Lemma sections already have the <kbd>-</kbd> buttons unlocked. This gives
back the full price paid into the upgrade. This allows for upgrade
swapping or dropping upgrades at the very end to hit the lemma limit
early. The amount respeced is based on the x1, x10, x25, x100, xMax in
the top right. On the right side, you can see the total levels bought.
There is also a free reset top right if a mistake is made.
