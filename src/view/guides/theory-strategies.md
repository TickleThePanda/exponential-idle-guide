### Theory 1: Recurrence Relations

T1 is one of the theories that benefit the most from active strategies. T1SolarXLII improves slightly on T1AI.

- T1SolarXLII
- T1AI
- T1C34

### Theory 2: Differential Calculus

T2 is the only theory without an active strategy, despite attempts.

- T2MC
- T2Coast-X%
- T2

### Theory 3: Linear Algebra

T3 has the most variables of any theory and has benefitted the most from player-created strategies.
T3SNAX is currently the best idle strategy above e200œÅ.
T3SNAX2 is similar to T3SNAX but is designed to be QoL compatible.

- T3<span style="color:var(--palette-stroke-warning)">No</span>C11C13C33

### Theory 4: Polynomials

T4 is the third-strongest theory in endgame, only behind T5 and T6.

- T4C3d66
- T4C3d
- T4C3dC12rcv
- T4C3
- T4C123d
- T4C123
- T4C12d
- T4C12
- T4C5
- T4C6
- T4

### Theory 5: Logistic Function

T5 is the second-strongest theory in endgame, only behind T6.

- T5AI
- T5Idle xexxx
- T5

### Theory 6: Integral Calculus

T6 is the most powerful theory in endgame, with several players reaching well over e1100ùúè on their main save, some even over e1200ùúè.

- T6SNAX x.xxexxx
- T6<span style="color:var(--palette-stroke-warning)">No</span>C34d

- T6<span style="color:var(--palette-stroke-warning)">No</span>C345d
- T6<span style="color:var(--palette-stroke-warning)">No</span>C345

### Theory 7: Numerical Methods

T7 is the third-weakest theory, ahead of T2 and T8.
T7PlaySpqcey is a slightly faster version of T7Play-25.

- T7PlaySpqcey
- T7Play-25
- T7C3d
- T7C12d
- T7C123d
- T7<span style="color:var(--palette-stroke-warning)">No</span>C12

- T7<span style="color:var(--palette-stroke-warning)">No</span>C124
- T7<span style="color:var(--palette-stroke-warning)">No</span>C1234
- T7

### Theory 8: Chaos Theory

T8 is the weakest theory in endgame and has the most active strategy of any theory (T8PlaySolarSwap)
T8 also has the largest number of strategies (20+ total), but only those I have seen recommended by the sim are shown here.

### Official Custom Theories
In chronological order of release.

### Custom Theory 1: Weierstra√ü Sine Product

The first official custom theory, abbreviated WSP, was created by xelaroc and released on January 15, 2022.

- WSPAI
- WSPd<span style="color:var(--palette-stroke-warning)">Stop</span>C1

### Custom Theory 2: Sequential Limits

The second official custom theory, abbreviated SL, was created by ellipsis and released on January 22, 2022.

- SL<span style="color:var(--palette-stroke-warning)">Stop</span>Ad
- SL<span style="color:var(--palette-stroke-warning)">Stop</span>A

### Custom Theory 3: Euler's Formula

The third/fourth official custom theory, abbreviated EF, was first planned by Snaeky, coded by peanut, and balanced with help by XLII. It was released on May 4, 2022, in the same update as CSR2 and the tau cap increase.

- EFAI (post-e50œÅ)
- EFSNAX
- EFd
- EF

### Custom Theory 4: Convergents to ‚àö2

The third/fourth official custom theory, abbreviated CSR2 or CS2, was created by Solarion. It was released on May 4, 2022, in the same update as Euler‚Äôs Formula and the CT tau cap increase from e100 to e150.
