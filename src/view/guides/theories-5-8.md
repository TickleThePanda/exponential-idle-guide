### Graduation routing

Remember to follow our routing advice from the [introduction](/guides/intro/#graduation-routing).

 - 9k ‚Üí 9.4k (push for z1.04 at \\(ee9160\\)) ‚Üí 9.8k ‚Üí 10k
 - 10k ‚Üí 10.4k ‚Üí 10.6k ‚Üí 11k (push for z1.08 at \\(ee10821\\))
 - 11k ‚Üí 12.4k ‚Üí 13.4k ‚Üí 14k+ \[tau(œÑ)~1350+\] **Skip T8**
 - 14k ‚Üí 14.8k ‚Üí 15.6k ‚Üí 16k \[tau(œÑ)~1600+\]
 - 16k ‚Üí 16.8k ‚Üí 18k \[tau(œÑ)~1e1800+\]
 - 18k ‚Üí Can be done in one but unsure about speed ) ‚Üí 20k \[tau(œÑ)~2050-2100+\]

#### Student Use Routing

All Routing below assumes you buy ALL available theories unless
explicitly stated because theories are important to start as soon as
possible as they function outside of the main game. When you are not
pushing \\(f(t)\\) you should always have the 9th research option maxed
(after Theory 8).

##### How to push \\(f(t)\\) with R9 seapping

- Memorize your student distributions with and without 30 R9 students.
- Auto prestige off
- Wait till \\(f(t)\\) stops growing without student respec
- Start accel (preferably keep it between prestiges)
- Respec the 10/20/30 students from R9 then respec back
- Potentially sit here to stack t and repeat the previous 2 steps. Only
  do it when you are near a graduation mark.
- Prestige (and turn back on after you graduate)

##### The new prestige equation

```
timer(d(ln(db/b+1)/pt)<0)>3*tr && db>b && ((d(smooth(10^10^10^phi,1))>1) && timer(abs(d(log10(phi)))<50)>15)
```

This method allows you to push \\(f(t)\\) with almost no loss of R9
uptime or pushing power. This is harder with fewer levels of R9 but
still helps if you get used to it.

### Theory 1 (20œÉ / 5k)

See our earlier guide for an overview for [theory 1](/guides/theories-1-4/#theory-1-20s-5k).

The long-term optimal multiplier converges to 2.56688 (courtesy of bigfreeze).
When this happens turn off the autobuyer and cruise to 3.

### Theory 2 (25œÉ / 6k)

See our earlier guide for an overview for [theory 2](/guides/theories-1-4/#theory-2-25s-6k).

### Theory 3 (30œÉ / 7k)

The basis of this theory and understanding how it works is based on matrix multiplication. Below I have put a color-coded image to display how matrix multiplication works: This gives the basis for why certain upgrades are more powerful than others. The exponents on b1, b2, and b3 are all directly affecting œÅ1 production which is used for tau. An extra dimension roughly gives 50% more tau production as it adds an extra term to ![](RackMultipart20210804-4-1jsoyt4_html_2c8372048e03888e.png)the œÅ1 production.

##### Strategy

The optimal publication multiplier is about 2-3 without cruising and 3-4 with cruising. If you decide to buy manually disable c11, c13, c21, c33. You will also focus on b2 then b3 then b1. For idle buying, just disable c11, c13, c21, c33, and autobuy the rest. At the end of any publication, around a 2-3 multiplier, you should turn off b1 and c31 as they cost rho1. You will cruise until you get to a 3-4 multiplier. Publish and turn b1 and c31 back on, and repeat.

##### Milestone Route

Active: Idle:

0/0/0 ‚Üí [0/0/2 ‚Üí 1/0/2/0 ‚Üí 1/0/2/2 ‚Üí 1/2/2/1] ‚Üí 1/2/2/2 0/0/0 ‚Üí 0/0/2 ‚Üí 0/2/2 ‚Üí 1/0/2/2 ‚Üí 1/2/2/2

or equivalently [3 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 4] ‚Üí 4 or equivalently 3 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 1 ‚Üí4‚Üí 4

### Theory 4 (35œÉ / 8k)

We start out with just one term of constants c1c2 and a changing term c3q with q being equal to q(t+dt)=q+\*dt with dt=0.1 for each tick. is equal to an inverse equation of with q being the current value. The first milestone increases the power of c1 from 1.00 to 1.15. The next 3 milestones we grab add more terms to the equation with c4q2, c5q3, and c6q4. We end by increasing by a factor of 2^x up to 23 or 8.

**Initial: First Milestone: Second Milestone:**

=c1c2+c3q =c1c2+c3q+c4q2 =c1c2+c3q+c4 q2+c5q3

q(t+dt)=q+\*dt q(t+dt)=q+\*dt q(t+dt)=q+\*dt

**3rd Milestone: 4th-6th Milestone: 7th Milestone:**

=c1c2+c3q+c4 q2+c5q3+c6q4 =c1c2+c3q+c4q2+c5q3+c6q4 =c11.15c2+c3q+c4q2+c5q3+c6q4

q(t+dt)=q+\*dt q(t+dt)=q+23\*\*dt q(t+dt)=q+23\*\*dt

##### Strategy

The optimal publication multiplier is 4-6. During publications, start with x/1/3. After you will switch to 3/1/x. This will be repeated back and forth throughout the publication. If you decide to manually buy and don&#39;t have max milestones, focus on q1 and q2. The next priority is going from the highest cx upgrade down to c1. Each lower priority should be bought e1 cheaper than the priority tier above. If you decide to manually buy at max milestones, at the beginning of publications, buy c1, c2, c3, q1, and q4. Once you are within e1-e2 of your publication mark, swap to only buying c3, q1, and q2.

##### Milestone Route

0/0/0 ‚Üí [3/0/0 ‚Üí 3/0/2] ‚Üí 3/0/3 ‚Üí 3/1/3

or equivalently 1 ‚Üí 1 ‚Üí 1 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 2


### Theory 5 (40œÉ / 9k)

**q1&q2** - Simple multipliers that directly affect rho(œÅ) production. q2 is a doubling while q1 is not.

**q -** The crux of T5 is to grow this value as fast as possible, while increasing its maximum value.

**c1**** -** Increases the speed that q will approach its limit.

You need enough levels of c1 to allow q to reach its limit, once q has reached its cap c1 has no additional benefit until more c2 is purchased.

**c2 -** Doubles the limit of q and halves the effect of c1.

Needed to balance 2 parts of the equation. It appears twice: [c1/c2] and [c31.1-q/c2]. If you buy too much c2, it will make q growth effectively nothing as [c1/c2] approaches 0. However, you still need to buy c2 because when q approaches c2\*c31.1, [c31.1-q/c2] approaches 0 as well making q=c2\*c31.1 the maximum value of q.

**c3**** -** Increases the limit of q by 2(1+milestones/20).

Increases q limit by increasing what [q/c2] fraction can reach, doesn&#39;t have the problems of c2 as lowering your q dot, making it an always auto-bought variable.

###### ![](RackMultipart20210804-4-1jsoyt4_html_1a5c5674698ec0ac.jpg)Strategy

Theory 5 benefits the most from active play and a lot of attention for best results making it the strongest theory until the very late game due to a very low multiplier decay rate. The optimal publication multiplier is still unknown, but here is what is known: 3 until e25; 6 to 10 during mid to late game. Publishing at higher multiples is not drastically less efficient and allows for slightly less active play.

####### Active Strategy

Running the active strats, with some modifications, will help you get this theory to e30 easily, but it will take some time. A step-by-step on how to progress the theory is below.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pM-pjSnMByw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

######### Before e30

1. Buy everything **except** c2
2. Once q growth reduces, c2 levels can then be purchased individually. Only buy when c2 is e1 lower than your current rho, shown visually on the graph when it plateaus.
3. When you are within e10 of your last publication, you should buy everything but q1 and c1. You should then manually buy q1 and c1 when it costs e1 lower than q2 doubling. (c1 only when q is not capped)
4. Repeat until e25. At e25, push for e30 with 0/1/0 milestone and start x6-10 multipliers.

######### After autobuy at e30

1. x1 (or x10 when above e200) buy c2 manually and autobuy the rest until within ~e10 of your previous publication. Your graph should resemble a linear function on the graph. (see image above)
2. As purchasing c2 becomes less frequent and q growth will slow down at this point you should stop autobuying c1 & q1
3. Around your last pub mark, you can start auto-buying c2. At this point, you should
  1. Buy q1 up to 15% of the cost of the next doubling purchase (2^x purchase)
  2. Buy c1 after you purchase c2 until q reaches its new cap
4. Once you reach your desired multiplier, publish. Rinse and repeat this for stonks.

[T5 Active Guide with Commentary](https://youtu.be/AYI4U7Aob6o)

Note: T5 will always give its best results from active play. However, after step 3, you can still get good results while auto buying q1 and manually purchasing c1 every 10-15min. Making the theory slightly less active.

**DO NOT OVERNIGHT THIS THEORY**

### Theory 6 (45œÉ / 10k)

###### Strategy

This theory has the lowest decay of all the theories. It will be second place to T5 until about e750 and is currently the only theory that can get to e1000+. You should overnight this after you get your T2 to e350. This is the best idle theory. T6 at endgame: [Video](https://tinyurl.com/282z4pz8)

The optimal publication multiplier is still unknown but empirically seems to be about 7-12. Once all milestones, disable c3 c4 and autobuy rest. For manual autobuy q2, r2, c2, and c5 then manual buy rest with c3 and c4 still disabled. For Idle/auto, you are going to just turn off c3and c4.

### Theory 7 (50œÉ / 11k)

##### Strategy

The optimal publication multiplier is 4-6. The strategy for manual buy before 1/1/1/1/0 is to only manual buy q1 and c1 with the rest auto. Buy c1 and q1 when you can buy them for cheap (~x10 less rho). Between 0/0/2 and 1/0/0/1/3 can be switched to full auto.

##### Milestone Route

0/0/0 ‚Üí 0/1/0 ‚Üí 0/1/1 and later 0/0/2 ‚Üí0/0/3 ‚Üí 0/1/3 ‚Üí 1/1/1/1/1 ‚Üí 1/1/0/1/3 or 1/1/1/1/2 ‚Üí 1/1/1/1/3

Or equivalently 3-3-3-2-1 {5 twice for 3 and 4} -3-2

**T8 Skipping:**

T8 skip is significantly faster than buying T8 right away. T8 is very slow until you get to about e60 (it took the sim 16 hours to get that far the theory). We highly recommend buying t8 for the achievement, then selling it right away and using those students for phi. You will need about 1350 tau in order to get R9 (ee14k), which will help you get through T8 faster than before. The current _ **recommendation** _ for your tau distribution is as follows:

**T1:** 200 **T2:** 275 **T3:** 150 **T4:** 175 **T5:** 250 **T6:** 150 **T7:** 150

 If your numbers are different, that is fine. You just need to reach 1350 _ **TOTAL TAU** _ to get to R9 at 14k.

### Theory 8 (55œÉ / 12k)

##### Strategy

The optimal publication multiplier is 2.5-5 depending on how close you are to the next milestone. This theory is extremely slow at the start which is why we skip until we obtain R9. It is also the only one with a 1e20 milestone multiplier. It will speed up once you hit 1e60 and even faster at 1e80 and 1e100 until ~e250-e300. The worst part is the 1e50-1e60 grind. The grind to 1e60 will take a good bit of time but is faster with R9 now.

At the start, manual buy prioritizes c2 then c1 then rest. Once you get to 0/0/0/2, prioritize c2 and c5 then the rest. Once at 1/0/3/0, you will prioritize c2 and c4 and then the rest after. This continues to max at 2/3/3/3.
