### Graduation routing

Remember to follow our routing advice from the [introduction](/guides/intro/#graduation-routing).

1. 9k â†’ 9.4k (push for z1.04 at \\(ee9160\\)) â†’ 9.8k â†’ 10k
2. 10k â†’ 10.4k â†’ 10.6k â†’ 11k (push for z1.08 at \\(ee10821\\))
3. 11k â†’ 12.4k â†’ 13.4k â†’ 14k+ \[tau(Ï„)~1350+\]
4. **Skip T8**
5. 14k â†’ 14.8k â†’ 15.6k â†’ 16k \[tau(Ï„)~1600+\]
6. 16k â†’ 16.8k â†’ 18k \[tau(Ï„)~1e1800+\]
7. 18k â†’ Can be done in one but unsure about speed ) â†’ 20k \[tau(Ï„)~2050-2100+\]

#### Student Use Routing

All Routing below assumes you buy ALL available theories unless
explicitly stated because theories are important to start as soon as
possible as they function outside of the main game. When you are not
pushing \\(f(t)\\) you should always have the 9th research option maxed
(after Theory 8).

The following are the best \\(\phi_1\\) routes.

##### \\(\phi_1\\) route (when \\(\phi_1\\) >= \\(\phi_3\\))

Remember acceleration increases \\(\phi_1\\).

1. Theory 5 0/0/1/0/0 â†’ 0/0/0/2/0 â†’ 2/0/0/1/0 then 0/0/2/1/0
2. Theory 6 â†’ 2/0/0/0/0 then 0/0/0/2/0 â†’ 2/0/1/0/0 then 1/0/0/2/0 then 0/0/0/2/1
3. Theory 7 â†’ 2/2/2/1/0/0 then 0/1/0/2/2/2 â†’ 4/2/2/2/0/0 then 2/2/2/2/2/2/0]
4. **Skip theory 8**
4. R9 lvl 1 then 2/0/2/2/2/2 â†’ R9+0/0/0/2/2/0 then 2/2/2/2/3/2/ â†’ R9+2/0/2/2/2/0 then 2/2/2/2/4/2/1
5. R9 lvl 2 then 2/2/2/2/4/2/2 â†’ R9 lvl 2+0/0/0/2/2/0 then 2/2/2/2/4/3/3
6. R9 lvl 3 then 2/2/2/2/4/4/5

##### \\(\phi_3\\) route (when \\(\phi_3\\) >= \\(\phi_1\\))

Remember acceleration increases \\(phi_1\\).

1. No Theory 5: 1/0/2/2/0 then 0/0/1/2/2 â†’ 2/1/2/2/0 then 1/0/2/2/2 â†’ 2/2/2/2/1 then 2/1/2/2/2
2. Theory 6 â†’ 0/0/2/0/0 then 0/0/0/2/0 â†’ 1/0/2/0/0 then 0/0/1/2/0 then 0/0/0/2/1
3. Theory 7 â†’ 2/2/2/1/0/0 then 0/1/0/2/2/2 â†’ 2/2/4/2/0/0 then 2/2/2/2/2/2/0]
4. **Skip theory 8**
4. R9 then 2/0/2/2/2/2â†’ R9+0/0/0/2/2/0 then 2/2/2/2/3/2/ â†’ R9+2/0/2/2/2/0 then 2/2/2/2/4/2/1
5. R9 lvl 2 then 2/2/2/2/4/2/2 â†’ R9 lvl 2+0/0/0/2/2/0 then 2/2/2/2/4/3/3
6. R9 lvl 3 then 2/2/2/2/4/4/5
7. Theory 9

##### How to push \\(f(t)\\) with R9 seapping

1. Memorize your student distributions with and without 30 R9 students.
2. Auto prestige off
3. Wait till \\(f(t)\\) stops growing without student respec
4. Start accel (preferably keep it between prestiges)
5. Respec the 10/20/30 students from R9 then respec back
6. Potentially sit here to stack t and repeat the previous 2 steps. Only
   do it when you are near a graduation mark.
7. Prestige (and turn back on after you graduate)

##### The new prestige equation

```
timer(d(ln(db/b+1)/pt)<0)>3*tr && db>b && ((d(smooth(10^10^10^phi,1))>1) && timer(abs(d(log10(phi)))<50)>15)
```

This method allows you to push \\(f(t)\\) with almost no loss of R9
uptime or pushing power. This is harder with fewer levels of R9 but
still helps if you get used to it.

### Theory 1 (20Ïƒ / 5k)

See our earlier guide for an overview for [theory 1](/guides/theories-1-4/#theory-1-20s-5k).

#### Changes to T1 strategy

The long-term optimal multiplier converges to 2.56688 (courtesy of bigfreeze).
When this happens turn off the autobuyer and cruise to 3.

### Theory 4 (35Ïƒ / 8k)

### Theory 5 (40Ïƒ / 9k)

\\(q_1\\) & \\(q_2\\). Simple multipliers that directly affect \\(\rho\\)
production. \\(q_2\\) is a doubling while \\(q_1\\) is not.

\\(q\\). The crux of T5 is to grow this value as fast as possible, while
increasing its maximum value.

\\(c_1\\). Increases the speed that \\(q\\) will approach its limit. You
need enough levels of \\(c_1\\) to allow \\(q\\) to reach its limit,
once \\(q\\) has reached its cap \\(c_1\\) has no additional benefit
until more \\(c_2\\) is purchased.

\\(c_2\\). Doubles the limit of \\(q\\) and halves the effect of \\(c_1\\).
Needed to balance 2 parts of the equation. It appears twice: \\(c_1/c_2\\)
and \\(c_3^{1.1}-q/c_2\\). If you buy too much \\(c_2\\), it will make
\\(q\\) growth effectively nothing as \\(c_1/c_2\\) approaches \\(0\\).
However, you still need to buy \\(c_2\\) because when \\(q\\) approaches
\\(c_2*c_3^{1.1}\\), \\(c_3^{1.1}-q/c_2\\) approaches \\(0\\) as well
making \\(q=c_2*c_3^{1.1}\\) the maximum value of \\(q\\).

\\(c_3\\). Increases the limit of \\(q\\) by \\(2^{1+m/20}\\) where \\(m\\)
is the number of milestones. Increases \\(q\\) limit by increasing what
\\(q/c_2\\) fraction can reach, doesn't have the problems of \\(c_2\\)
as lowering your \\(\dot{q}\\), making it an always auto-bought variable.

#### T5 strategy

Theory 5 benefits the most from active play and a lot of attention for
best results making it the strongest theory until the very late game due
to a very low multiplier decay rate. The optimal publication multiplier
is still unknown, but here is what is known: \\(3\\) until \\(e25\\);
\\(6\\) to \\(10\\) during mid to late game. Publishing at higher
multiples is not drastically less efficient and allows for slightly less
active play.

##### Active

Running the active strats, with some modifications, will help you get
this theory to \\(e30\\) easily, but it will take some time. A step-by-step on
how to progress the theory is below.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pM-pjSnMByw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Before e30, you should:

1. Buy everything **except** \\(c_2\\)
2. Once \\(q\\) growth reduces, \\(c_2\\) levels can then be purchased
   individually. Only buy when \\(c_2\\) is \\(e_1\\) lower than your
   current \\(\rho\\), shown visually on the graph when it plateaus.
3. When you are within \\(e10\\) of your last publication, you should buy
   everything but \\(q_1\\) and \\(c_1\\). You should then manually buy
   \\(q_1\\) and \\(c_1\\) when it costs \\(e_1\\) lower than \\(q_2\\)
   doubling. (\\(c_1\\) only when \\(q\\) is not capped)
4. Repeat until \\(e25\\). At \\(e25\\), push for \\(e30\\) with 0/1/0
   milestone and start x6-10 multipliers.

After autobuy at e30, you should:

1. x1 (or x10 when above \\(e200\\)) buy \\(c_2\\) manually
   and autobuy the rest until within ~\\(e10\\) of your previous
   publication. Your graph should resemble a linear function on the
   graph.
2. As purchasing \\(c_2\\) becomes less frequent and \\(q\\) growth will
   slow down at this point you should stop autobuying \\(c_1\\) & \\(q_1\\)
3. Around your last pub mark, you can start auto-buying \\(c_2\\). At this point, you should
   1. Buy \\(q_1\\) up to \\(15%\\) of the cost of the next doubling purchase (\\(2^x\\) purchase)
   2. Buy \\(c_1\\) after you purchase \\(c_2\\) until \\(q\\) reaches its new cap
4. Once you reach your desired multiplier, publish. Rinse and repeat this for stonks.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AYI4U7Aob6o" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

T5 will always give its best results from active play. However, after
step 3, you can still get good results while auto buying \\(q_1\\) and
manually purchasing \\(c_1\\) every 10-15min. Making the theory
slightly less active.

**Warning**: do not overnight this theory.

#### T5 milestone route

[0/1/0 â†’ 3/1/0 â†’ 3/1/2]

Purchase \\(c_2\\) when  \\(1.5q > c_2*c_3^{m_3}\\). \\(m_3\\) is
the number of milestone 3.

\\(q\\) begins to slow down when you reach \\(2q > c_2*c_3^{m_3}\\).

### Theory 6 (45Ïƒ / 10k)

#### T6 strategy

This theory has the lowest decay of all the theories. It will be second
place to T5 until about e750 and is currently the only theory that can
get to \\(>e1000\\). You should overnight this after you get your T2 to
\\(e350\\). This is the best idle theory. [Video of T6 at endgame](https://tinyurl.com/282z4pz8)

The optimal publication multiplier is still unknown but empirically
seems to be about \\(7\\)-\\(12\\). Once all milestones, disable \\(c_3\\)
\\(c_4\\) and autobuy rest. For manual autobuy \\(q_2\\), \\(r_2\\),
\\(c_2\\), and \\(c_5\\) then manual buy rest with \\(c_3\\) and \\(c_4\\)
still disabled. For idle/auto, you are going to just turn off \\(c_3\\)
and \\(c_4\\).

#### T6 milestone

 - 0/0/0 â†’ 0/1/0 â†’ 1/1/0/0 â†’ 1/1/1/0 â†’ 1/0/0/3 â†’ 1/0/1/3 â†’ 1/1/1/3
 - or equivalently 2-1-3-4 {2 and 3 for 4 twice} -3-2

### Theory 7 (50Ïƒ / 11k)

#### T7 strategy

The optimal publication multiplier is \\(4\\)-\\(6\\). The strategy for
manual buy before 1/1/1/1/0 is to only manual buy \\(q_1\\) and \\(c_1\\)
with the rest auto. Buy \\(c_1\\) and \\(q_1\\) when you can buy them
for cheap (~x10 less \\(\rho\\)). Between 0/0/2 and 1/0/0/1/3 can be
switched to full auto.

#### T7 milestone

 - 0/0/0 â†’ 0/1/0 â†’ 0/1/1 and later 0/0/2 â†’0/0/3 â†’ 0/1/3 â†’ 1/1/1/1/1 â†’ 1/1/0/1/3 or 1/1/1/1/2 â†’ 1/1/1/1/3
 - Or equivalently 3-3-3-2-1 {5 twice for 3 and 4} -3-2

### Theory 8 skipping

T8 skip is significantly faster than buying T8 right away. T8 is very
slow until you get to about \\(e60\\) (it took the sim 16 hours to get that
far the theory). We highly recommend buying t8 for the achievement, then
selling it right away and using those students for \\(\phi\\). You will need
about 1350 \\(\tau\\) in order to get R9 (\\(ee14k\\)), which will help you get
through T8 faster than before. The current _recommendation_ for
your \\(\tau\\) distribution is as follows:

 - **T1:** 200
 - **T2:** 275
 - **T3:** 150
 - **T4:** 175
 - **T5:** 250
 - **T6:** 150
 - **T7:** 150

If your numbers are different, that is fine. You just need to reach 1350
\\(\Pi\tau\\) to get to R9 at 14k.

### Theory 8 (55Ïƒ / 12k)

#### T8 strategy

The optimal publication multiplier is 2.5-5 depending on how close you
are to the next milestone. This theory is extremely slow at the start
which is why we skip until we obtain R9. It is also the only one with a
\\(1e20\\) milestone multiplier. It will speed up once you hit 1e60 and
even faster at \\(1e80\\) and \\(1e100\\) until ~\\(e250\\)-\\(e300\\).
The worst part is the \\(1e50\\)-\\(1e60\\) grind. The grind to \\(1e60\\)
will take a good bit of time but is faster with R9 now.

At the start, manual buy prioritizes \\(c_2\\) then \\(c_1\\) then rest.
Once you get to 0/0/0/2, prioritize \\(c_2\\) and \\(c_5\\) then the
rest. Once at 1/0/3/0, you will prioritize \\(c_2\\) and \\(c_4\\) and
then the rest after. This continues to max at 2/3/3/3.

The starting positions for each of the three attractors are:

 - Lorenz: -6, -8, 26
 - Chen: -10.6, -4.4, 28.6
 - Rossler: -6, 15, 0

The time step for each of the three attractors are:
 - Lorenz: 0.02
 - Chen: 0.002
 - Rossler: 0.00014

#### T8 milestone route

 - 0/0/0/0 â†’ 1/0/0/0 â†’ 2/0/0/0 (\\(e40\\)-\\(e52\\)) â†’ 0/0/0/2 (\\(e52\\)-\\(e60\\)) â†’ 0/0/0/3 â†’ 1/0/0/3 â†’ 2/0/3/0 â†’ 2/3/3/3
 - or equivalently 1-1-{swap 1's to 4} â†’ 4 â†’ 1 â†’ 1 {4's swap to 3's}â†’ 1 â†’ 2 â†’ 2 â†’ 2 â†’ 4 â†’ 4 â†’ 4
