### Overview

The basis of this theory and understanding how it works is based on
matrix multiplication. Below I have put a color-coded image to display
how matrix multiplication works.

This gives the basis for why certain upgrades are more powerful than
others. The exponents on \\(b_1\\), \\(b_2\\), and \\(b_3\\)
are all directly affecting \\(ρ_1\\) production which is used for \\(\tau\\). An extra
dimension roughly gives \\(50%\\) more \\(\tau\\) production as it adds an extra term
to the \\(ρ_1\\) production.

### Strategy

The optimal publication multiplier is about 2-3 without cruising and 3-4
with cruising. If you decide to play actively, there is a form of
exponent swapping start to be aware of. This is not a difficult
strategy, but it requires you to notice when a certain threshold
happens. It happens when the following occurs:

\\[c_{11}*b_{1}^{1.05\text{ or }1.1}<c_{12}*b_{2}^{1.05\text{ or }1.1}\\]

When this happens swap your exponents from \\(b_1\\) to \\(b_2\\) and you will get a
little upgrade boost. It also allows for a slight push of \\(ρ_2\\) for
upgrades to \\(b_2\\) and \\(c_{12}\\), but this is a lot less impactful and less
noticeable. This strategy also works with \\(b_3\\) and \\(c_{13}\\) but is oftentimes
not as common and good to note anyways.

If you decide to buy manually, the focus areas are \\(b_1\\), \\(b_2\\), and \\(b_3\\) when
e1 lower than \\(c_{11}\\), \\(c_{12}\), and \\(c_{13}\\). These all directly boost the production
of \\(ρ_1\\) which is used for \\(\tau\\). After this, if doing the active exponent
swapping strat in the previous paragraph, the next focus will be on \\(c_{21}\\),
\\(c_{22}\\), and \\(c_{23}\\) as these boost \\(b_2\\) production which is the more likely cause
for the exponent swap to occur. This leaves the \\(c_{31}\\), \\(c_{32}\\), and \\(c_{33}\\)
upgrades as the last priority. If you are not using the exponent
swapping strat in the previous paragraph, then all the remaining
upgrades are at equivalent priority.

At the end of any publication, around a 2-3 multiplier, you should turn
off b1 and c31 as they cost rho1. You will cruise until you get to a
3-4 multiplier. Publish and turn back on rho1 costing variables and
repeat.

### Milestone Route
 - Active:
   - 0/0/0 → [0/0/2 → 1/0/2/0 → 1/2/2/0 → 1/2/2/1] → 1/2/2/2 or equivalently
   - [3 → 3 → 1 → 2 → 2 → 4] → 4
 - Idle:
   - 0/0/0 → 0/0/2 → 0/2/2 → 1/2/2/0 → 1/2/2/2 or equivalently
   - 3 → 3 → 2 → 2 → 1 → 4 → 4
