###### First read the [game basics](https://exponential-idle-guides.netlify.app/guides/ex-basics/).

### Introduction
The start of the game is the most variable section of the game depending on how active you play.
This guide will be split into 1 to ee50, ee50 to ee200, and ee200 to ee2000 sections for particular milestones. 
Within each of these sections there are idle, active, and general strategy subsections for differing playstyles.
Playing and molding both sections will often deliver the best results for a particular person's ability and situation.

### 1 to ee50

#### Prestige strategy before autoprestige

##### Before b>=1:

   - You do not want to prestige immediately when you hit 100%, but instead when \\(db\\) growth slows drastically.
   - I tend to do a prestige around db=.003, .025, .135, and the remainder to hit \\(b\\)>=1. This is variable and can change based on how fast you are moving.
   - Recovery after a prestige is standard at spamming all variables and buying upgrades occasionally (\\(\mu\\) upgrades instantly). This continues until the end of the prestige.

##### After b>=1: 

1. Recovery is based on spamming the <kbd>Buy All</kbd> button (you can get this in star upgrades), focusing variables and swapping to upgrades occasionally. 
- This may take a little bit to get back to your previous prestige point and the faster you spam the faster you get there. 
2. Pay attention to \\(db/b\\) growth.
- \\(db/b\\) growth is the largest factor to progress from a prestige, however, because of how early \\(f(t)\\) is, \\(\mu\\) upgrades still play a vital role and have to be taken into account.
- Once \\(db\\) reaches e3 more than \\(b\\), begin to pay attention how fast \\(db\\) is growing vs how long you have been spending on the prestige. When this slows drastically, you are at the end of a prestige.
3. Pay attention to \\(d\mu\\) growth. (Optional)
   - Make mental note of price of the two \\(\mu\\) upgrades are (<kbd>↑ dt upgrade</kbd> and <kbd>↑ y factor upgrade</kbd>). 
   - When \\(db\\) begins to drastically reduce its growth vs time, look at how fast your \\(d\mu\\) is growing. 
   - If \\(d\mu\\) is growing fast enough and is below the next \\(\mu\\) upgrade, it could be worth waiting to grab that as well. It is to note that y factor upgrades are a bigger overall boost than \\(dt\\) upgrades.
   - In the case that you are past one upgrade of the \\(\mu\\) upgrades and potentially another, you will have to do some mental math to check. 
Every <kbd>↑ dt upgrade</kbd> is 32,768x or ~3.28e4 more expensive per upgrade and every <kbd>↑ y factor upgrade</kbd> is 1,048,576x or ~1.05e6 more expensive per upgrade. You can add multiply the current shown \\(\mu\\) upgrade to get the next one and see if you are close to buying a 2nd. This doesn't happen often but can help to check.
4.  After checking \\(d\mu\\) growth, ability to purchase \\(\mu\\) upgrades, and \\(db\\) growth, you can prestige when all of these have slowed drastically.
5.  Repeat this cycle.

#### Active strategies

##### Equation taps

Each tap of the equation, increases t by \\(1 * (ad\\) \\( boost\\) \\( of\\) \\( 1.5) * accel\\) \\( value\\). This is a significant boost to progress until about ee15-ee20.
After, dt becomes too large for your taps to make a worthy and significant boost to progress.

##### Minigames

These can be unlocked once b>=1. Highest priority is doing 15-puzzle and saving up for the arrow puzzle.
You an buy variables and perm levels while you wait. 
Doing one game of expert arrow or a few of hard arrow makes up all the stars and more spent on arrow puzzle because of the achievements.
I would highly highly suggest focusing and learning hard arrow puzzle if you plan on playing minigames for stars as it is far and above the best stars/time.

##### Accel button

This upgrade only has value if you continuously and consistently use it.
If you are not using the accel at the moment, selling it will lead to more stars for variables and perm levels.
It gives an x2.85 boost to \\(dt\\) and game progress if you max out the hour cap everytime.

##### Star epgrades

Focus is on buying accel button if you will use it then variables. Leftover stars can be used for permenant levels.
You will most likely not buy any autobuyers in this section as variables far and above give a bigger boost most cases.
If you do end up buying some then buy variable then upgrade autobuyer. 
You will not make it to autoprestige in this section unless extreme grinding but is worth the cost if you keep some variables.

#### Idle strategies

##### Minigames

These will not be of much value to you if you won't play them so not purchasing them is the best option.

##### Star upgrades

You will not purchase the accel button. When you go idle, focus purchase on the variable then upgrade autobuyer if you get them. You will most likely not have enough stars to get autoprestige or both autobuyers in this section.

### Supremacy

#### When To supremacy

**Upon reaching ee50, immediately supremacy.**

The general rule of thumb before ee2000 is whenever you have an upgrade available, to supremacy. 
There is an exception, however. The third supremacy for \\(y^{1.6}\\) costs 24 \\(\psi\\) and occurs at \\(f(t)\\)=ee140. 
You will want to skip this upgrade until you get to ee200 where you are forced to supremacy whether or not you obtainedthe \\(y^{1.6}\\) supremacy upgradebeforehand. 
It is better to combine both of these supremacies into one than have to recovery from one and do another.

#### Supremacy recovery (Active)

1. Drop variables that won't be purchasable immediately. This will be most of them initially.
2. Put the extra stars into perm levels into the last variable.
3. As you progress with more \\(f(t)\\), use the [variable lookup table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17lJ4IIIXfDAoO-TA76pwjNoZd2W9tQI9KRjENcs5Ybw/edit#gid=0) for when to buy the next variable.
- If you can afford to buy a level in the next variable, it is worth buying that variable and moving perm levels to it.
- After buying a new variable, move the perm levels from the previous variable into the new last variable.
4. Progress normally and repeat until back to previous supremacy mark.

#### Supremacy recovery (Idle)

1. Keep all variables that you could purchase up to the most recent \\(f(t)\\) with their normal perm levels.
2. If you do not have all the automation upgrades, you can take out some of the variables and perm levels for autobuyers or autoprestige.
Otherwise keep variables unlocked.
3. Progress normally until back to previous supremacy mark.

### ee50 to ee200

#### Autoprestige

Automation routing changes per playstyle but here is the autoprestige equation to use when you unlock it.
###### Remember to change mode from ratio to expression by clicking <kbd>Ratio</kbd> twice to cycle. [Explanation of autoprestige expression]

```
timer(d(ln(db/b+1)/pt) < 0) 
> 3 * tr && db > b
```

#### Active strategies

##### Minigames

If you have not unlocked arrow puzzle yet, highest priority is doing 15-puzzle and saving up for the arrow puzzle.
You an buy variables and perm levels while you wait. 
Doing one game of expert arrow or a few of hard arrow makes up all the stars and more spent on arrow puzzle because of the achievements.
I would highly highly suggest focusing and learning hard arrow puzzle if you plan on playing minigames for stars as it is far and above the best stars/time.
If you have already unlocked and learned hard arrow, then not much to say besides continue on grinding stars.

##### Accel button

This upgrade only has value if you continuously and consistently use it.
If you are not using the accel at the moment, selling it will lead to more stars for variables and perm levels.
It gives an x2.85 boost to \\(dt\\) and thus the game if you max out the hour cap everytime.

##### Star upgrades

Buy accel button and use it for speed boost to the game and stars. You should be able to unlock both autobuyers and autoprestige relatively easy with only some star grinding. After you obtain autoprestige, input [the autoprestige equation](https://exponential-idle-guides.netlify.app/guides/1-ee2k/#autoprestige). You will continue to unlock variables and perm levels when cheap as you go. You will not want to buy the Automation Speed upgrades until cheap compared to variable cost. In other words: lvl 1 after \\(\zeta\\); lvl 2 after \\(\iota\\); and lvl 3 after \\(\xi\\) (the last variable. They don't provide much boost but are nice to have anyways. Any left over stars will go into perm levels.

#### Idle strategies

##### Minigames

These will not be of much value to you if you won't play them so not purchasing them or any more is the best option.

##### Star upgrades

If you don't use the accel button, don't buy it. When you can buy the autobuyers, buy the variable autobuyer then the upgrade autobuyer. After you obtain autoprestige, input [the autoprestige equation](https://exponential-idle-guides.netlify.app/guides/1-to-ee2k/#autoprestige). You will continue to unlock variables and perm levels when cheap as you go. You will not want to buy the Automation Speed upgrades until cheap compared to variable cost. In other words: lvl 1 after \\(\zeta\\); lvl 2 after \\(\iota\\); and lvl 3 after \\(\xi\\) (the last variable. They don't provide much boost but are nice to have anyways. Any left over stars will go into perm levels.

### ee200 to ee2000

#### Autosupremacy
There is a chance you get Autosupremacy before ee2000 if you star grind a lot. If not, you will get later. The equation below is the autosupremacy equation if you do happens to obtain it. There is an [explanation](https://exponential-idle-guides.netlify.app/guides/ex-basics/#autosupremacy-explanantion) if you wanted.
###### Note: Do a manual supremacy when you input this expression and never enter the edit expression field again afterwards. Make sure autobuyers are on x1 or xMax.
###### Remember to change mode from ratio to expression by clicking <kbd>Ratio</kbd> twice to cycle.
```
timer(d(ln(db/b+1)/pt) < 0) 
> 2 * tr && db > b
&& dpsi + psi > min(min(costUpS(1), 
costUpS(2)), costUpS(3))
&& ln(1 + max(1,log10(sf))/
smooth(max(1,log10(gf)), 
(st>tr) * ee99))/max(1,st)<
smooth(ln(1 + max(1,log10(sf))/
smooth(max(1,log10(gf)), (st>tr) 
* ee99))/max(1,st), (pt>tr) * ee99)
```

#### What are these \\(x_i\\) supremacy upgrades?
After you supremacy past the ee200 infinity, a 2nd new supremacy upgrade will unlock: <kbd>Unlock x₁</kbd>.

##### \\(x_i\\) Equation

\\(x_i ← x_i+x_{i-1}dt\\)

\\(x_0 = x\\)

##### \\(x_i\\) Equation explanation
The equation shown is the calculation done on every tick. Lets give the example of \\(x_1\\): \\(x_1 ← x_1+x*dt\\). Each tick, \\(x*dt\\) is added to \\(x_1\\). This is done for every new value of x and \\(dt\\). A simple way of phrasing it is as repeated addition of the product of \\(x*dt\\).

You will max all star upgrades besides perm levels (no attainable limit) and autosupremacy (only if you grind enough).

###### When you reach ee2000, graduate immediately. This also pushes infinity further and is optimal for graudation routing anyways.
