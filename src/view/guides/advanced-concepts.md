## Distribution Overpushing

### What is distribution overpushing?

A naive way to push a theory distribution is to push all 8 original theories until they have similar tau/hour gains. Distribution overpushing is when you push certain theories such that their tau/hours are less than others. This seems to contradict optimal play, as generally you'd gain more students quicker if you push all theories to equal rates. However, some theories do not benefit as much from the 3rd level of the 9th Research in the Students tab (3R9). Therefore it makes more sense to push theories that don't benefit much from additional students first. This allows us to use the additional students to accelerate the rates of theories that do benefit significantly from 3R9. 

### How theories are affected by additional students

We will compare the effect of students on taudot, vs the effect of time on taudot for each theory. For the equations below, 'K' is just a proportional constant, 'S' is the multiplier gained from having students (3R9 multiplier).

### Theory 1

We know that in theory 1, the c4 term dominates late game:
\\(\dot{\rho} = KS\rho^{0.3}\\)
\\(\rho = (KSt)^{0.7}\\)



### Theory 2
