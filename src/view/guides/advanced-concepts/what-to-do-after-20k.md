## What to do after ee20k f(t)?

### A controversial theory

After reaching ee20k f(t) and completing theory 9, you will unlock custom theories. Each custom theory gives up to 150 tau. It usually takes more than 3 months to reach this point. It takes approximately 1 month of active play for each custom theory to reach 100 tau. Therefore it is not feasible for us to reach e150 tau on all custom theories. 

After theory 9 completion, you might notice that the tau/hour of a lot of theories are very quick. In fact, because of 3R9, this tau/hour is one of the highest in the whole game. Because of this, it would be helpful to have something to reliably utilise this tau/hour peaks. 

There exists a custom theory can automatically buy variables according to pre-programmed rules. It can also automatically publish at close to optimal points. Furthermore, it can switch between different theories depending on the extrapolated tau/hour of each one. This custom theory is quite controversial amongst top players, however it is valid to use. The custom theory is called Theory Automator (TA) and it can be downloaded [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skyllic/Custom-Theories/main/Theory%20Automator.js)

An alternative overpush version of the same theory can be downloaded [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gen1Code/TA-Overpush/main/TA-Overpush.js)

### 2 TA versions? Which one should I choose?

The overpush oversion is for LONG term maximisation of ft and tau. It is better if you wish to play the game for at least 1 year. It is also better if you wish to climb the leaderboards LONG term. If you want more instant gratification, the 'standard' TA is better. It is also faster to ee50k ft. For a more detailed explanation on overpushing and cashing in, please see my other blog post on [overpushing](/guides/advanced-concepts/distribution-overpushing).

### How useful is TA for each theory?

TA does active strategies for you. It also automatically publishes for you. With these 2 facts, we can establish that TA is most useful for theories that have strong active strategies compared to idle strategies. It is also more useful for theories with short publication times. 

Therefore, the most useful theories for TA are T1, 3, 5, 7, 8. TA in particular is not really useful for T2 since it has long publication times already, AND there's no good active strategy in the first place. In fact, I'd recommend NOT using TA if you are to run T2. 

### How long to use Theory Automator (TA)

Here we assume that your goal is to maximise the ft gain. There are many factors to consider; the main one being how often do you check the game. The more often you check the game, the earlier you should stop using TA. We will go through a couple of examples and give generic advices:

#### Super Idle Player (once per week)

For this player, we will run TA until ee50k ft. We will then start to manually do T2 and possibly T6. We will run TA on everything else. At ee60k, we will consider manually do T4. Practically, we will never manually do T1, 3, 5, 7, 8 ever again.

#### Standard Idle Player (once per day)

For this player, we will run TA until about ee40k ft. We will then manually do T2 and T6. We will continue to run TA to about ee50k ft. We will then manually do T4 as well. We will continue to use TA for T1, 3, 5, 7, 8 until ee60k ft. Afterwards, we will then abandon TA and manually do all theories. 

#### Semi Active Player (3 times per day)

For this player, we will abandon using TA for T2 straight away. At about ee30k ft, we will also abandon using TA for T6. At about ee40k ft, we will abandon TA on T4. Finally, at about ee50k ft, we will abandon using TA for everything else. 

#### Hyper Active Player (10 times+ per day)

For this player, we will abandon using TA for T2, 4, 6 straight away. At about ee40k ft, we will abandon TA for everything.
