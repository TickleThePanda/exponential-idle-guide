## April 2023

No rankings because little time and I was on vacation and yeah, not feeling it. So instead thanks to one resourceful user (Eylanding, the honourable mention of the previous month) got ChatGPT to write up the news section.
To make it absolutely clear: it tried but it failed at accuracy, so don't believe anything and at best you have a laugh. The next month will include a proper write-up of the 2 happenings. And now enjoy (or just click the next month)!

of our players, Snaeky was rescued just in time! We want to express our deepest gratitude to all the 
players who came to Snaeky's aid, proving once again that the Exponential Idle community is a force to be
