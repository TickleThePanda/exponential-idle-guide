This is a site for guides for Exponential Idle.

Here are almost all of the resources that are used in the Discord.
This post will have the guides that were created by SneakyBuddy911 and
Baldy, the simulator (sim) by Antharion, and the calculator by Eaux.
If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

SneakyBuddy's has a [YouTube channel] with some guides there for a
couple of the theories and some other things that you might like.

These are the student and star optimizers, just input your
information, and it will tell you where to put everything:
